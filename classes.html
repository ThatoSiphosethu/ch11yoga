        <dt><strong><p><dd>
            Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your mat with your arms
            at your side with palms up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but
            deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away. When you are
            ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting
            position with crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful
            for all that you have in life. Namaste.
